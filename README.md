# JavaAssessment

What did you like about this project?

This project is similar to the course assignment created during the lesson, but is more challenging as we need to create more functions for the students
and their enrolled courses

What did you struggle with in this project?

I have problem with the string comparison, in the findCourseById function, but resolved it by using string.equal() function

What would make your experience with this assessment better?

If I could modify some of the given function, I could make the user input validation more consistent. 
Eg in "Enroll student to course" , I could add a loop for user to keep entering StudentID until the correct student Id is entered. 
Currently it goes back to the main menu when student ID is invalid
